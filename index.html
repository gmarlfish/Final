    <p>Here we see that on the UNA Pay Tuition page, there is an unneeded Radio check for wanting to allow the authorized user to view Billing Statement, Account activity, Payment history.</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>I figured this could be solved by just adding a simple check box with all of the available options to select in one. This is more efficent (less clicks) and would save some clutter.</p>
        <h4>Follow the Link</h4>
        <p>This <a href="newindex.html" target="_blank">Link</a> will show the new and improved possible setup that UNA ePay could use to save some clutter just by incorporating a few jQuery, Javascript, and JSON techniques.</p>
